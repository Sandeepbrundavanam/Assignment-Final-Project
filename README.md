I designed and developed a secure web-based login portal for Arizona State University students using Flask and MySQL. The system featured user authentication, session management, and secure password handling using bcrypt hashing. I implemented form validation to ensure data integrity and added protection against SQL injection and other common web vulnerabilities. The application included login, registration, and password reset functionality with secure cookie management for session security. I also created RESTful endpoints for database interactions and built the frontend using HTML, CSS, and Flask templates, focusing on user experience and security best practices.
